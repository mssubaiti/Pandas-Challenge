# Pandas-Challenge
4th challenge - Pandas

The data used for this analysis is provided in two separate CSV files:

schools_complete.csv: This CSV file contains information about each school in the district
students_complete.csv: This CSV contains information about each student in the district
Using Python Pandas, the two csv files were merged and cleaned.

After analysing the data, it was found that there are 15 schools in the District area. The analysis also showed that the average math score for the district was about 79% , and the average reading score was around 82%. The overall passing rate, which is the percentage of students who passed both math and reading with a score above 70% in each, was 65%. The overall score provides us the ability to identity the top and bottom 5 performing schools in the district. The Totp 5 all scored over 90%: 

Cabrera High School - 91%
Thomas High School - 90.9%
Pena High School - 90.5%
Griffin High School - 90.5%
Wilson High School - 90.5%

while the bottom 5 all ranged in the 52%-53% range

Rodriguez High School - 52-9%
Figueroa High School - 53.2%
Huang High School - 53.5%
Johnson High School - 53.5%
Ford High School - 53.5%

The analysis also focused on Math and Reading scores seperately, based on the grades off the students. It appears that the 12th graders scored slightly higher in Math than those in 9th grade on average. The difference in average is barely 0.1% between all grades in fact, but it could be something to note in case of future fluctuations.
Same goes for the reading average in scores. the difference between the grade levels average is very little it would almost be deamed insignificant and ignorable, but it is wise to keep track and note of them for future evaluations. 

The analysis also studied the spending and budgets of the different schools and i beleive it is important to note that there is no relation betweeen higher scores and higher budgets. In fact it is the opposite that is true, the lower budget schools showcase higher overall grade averages. The schools that have a spending range of $585 or less have an overall % passing score of 90.3% while the schools with spending habits of $645 to $680 have an average of 53.5% overall passing score. 

It is also made obvious that the type of school also plays an importnat role in the overall passing score of the school. Charter schools scored 90% vs district schools that scored 53%. 


It is important to note that districts should look into the teaching styles of charter schools and to evaluate how lower spendng schools are budgeting themselves and what they are putting the budget towards.
